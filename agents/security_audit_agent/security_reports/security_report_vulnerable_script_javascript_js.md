# Security Vulnerability Report

**Code Scanned:** Javascript Express.js application

## Findings:


### A03: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Severity:** High

**Location:** Line 44: app.post('/api/login', (req, res)

**Description:** The POST request to /api/login lacks CSRF protection. A malicious website could trick a logged-in user into submitting a request to this endpoint, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.

**Implications:** Account takeover, unauthorized data modification, or other actions depending on the functionality of the /api/login endpoint.

**Remediation:** Implement CSRF protection, such as CSRF tokens, to validate requests and prevent unauthorized submissions.

**Example Code:**


### A01: Injection - Vulnerability 1

**Severity:** Critical

**Location:** Line 20-24: app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => { ... }

**Description:** Vulnerable to SQL injection due to string concatenation in the query.  User-supplied input ('userId') is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Implications:** Complete database compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access and modification.

**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Avoid string concatenation when constructing SQL queries.

**Example Code:**


### A01: Injection - Vulnerability 2

**Severity:** Critical

**Location:** Line 29-35: app.get('/api/search', (req, res) => { ... }

**Description:** Vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of template literals without parameterized queries. User-supplied input ('searchTerm') is directly embedded into the SQL query, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Implications:** Data breaches, unauthorized data access and modification, denial of service.

**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.  Sanitize user input properly before including it in SQL queries.

**Example Code:**


### A01: Injection - Vulnerability 3

**Severity:** Critical

**Location:** Line 40-53: app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => { ... }

**Description:** Vulnerable to SQL injection due to string concatenation in the query.  User-supplied input ('username' and 'password') are directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Implications:** Account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized access.

**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  Avoid string concatenation when constructing SQL queries.

**Example Code:**


**Note:** The SQL injection vulnerabilities were not detected by the initial static analysis tool. Manual code review and dynamic testing are recommended to identify additional vulnerabilities.
